# ARTIGENZ Student Community

ARTIGENZ is a student community initiated by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering with Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. The Community's mission is to make students all-rounders in the aspects of technology. ARTIGENZ is meant as  *“Artificial Intelligence Generations”*  which means the students of CSE-AIML will lead future generations to transform the nation. The motto of the Community is **“LEAD GENERATION TOGETHER”**.

ARTIGENZ Student Community conducts various events under the **“FESTOPIA”** which encourages students to participate in Co-curricular Activities and helps them build their esteem inside out in the aspects of leadership, coordination, collaboration, and growth. The ARTIGENZ Association conducts various Technical and Non-Technical events to make students All-rounders. The coordinators/achievers/participants will undoubtedly be benefited from tremendous accomplishments which can be used for professional resume building and portfolio presentation.

Artigenz ensures this by administering various technical and non-technical-themed events. This hones the leadership, communication, technical, and coordination skills of the students and contributes to the growth of students as all-rounders in society.
